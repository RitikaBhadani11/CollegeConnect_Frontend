College Connect – A Networking Platform for Students, Alumni & Faculty

College Connect is a full-stack web application built to connect students, alumni, and faculty members of a college
on a single, reliable platform. It allows users to create professional profiles, share their experiences, and explore
opportunities — whether it's for career growth, collaborations, or staying updated with the college network.

Why I Built This

In most colleges, once students graduate, they lose contact with classmates and faculty, and incoming students have
limited access to real-world guidance. Meanwhile, job seekers often struggle to keep track of opportunities spread 
across various platforms.

College Connect aims to solve this by providing a common space where users can not only stay connected but also explore
job opportunities, industry updates, and professional networks — all in one place. Whether someone is looking to hire,
share openings, or apply for jobs, this platform brings the community together to support each other's growth.
